<h1> TYPES OF CAKE </h1>
<p>
  It's hard to find someone who doesn't have strong feelings about a homemade cake recipe. We all have our favorites. For some, it might be a rich, and sweet cake. Others prefer their cake a little airier. But no matter your preferences, it's good to know the facts when it comes to different kinds of cake.
  There are two main types of cake: butter (also known as a "shortened" cake) and foam. And then within each category there are many varieties. The primary difference between the two cakes is the fat content. Shortened cakes have either butter, oil, or shortening in them. (A classic yellow cake is a perfect example.) Foam cakes have little to no fat and typically involve whipped eggs (either white, yolks, or both), which make them lighter and airier.

<h1>SIMPLE WHITE CAKE RECIPE</h1> 
This white cake recipe is the perfect classic white cake. Light and fluffy, moist and full of flavor. There is a joke in the cake world that white is not a flavor, it’s actually a vanilla cake. But a white cake is not just white. Let’s dive into what makes the perfect, white cake recipe. 
</p>
<p> 
Many people confuse white cake recipes with yellow cake or even vanilla cake. Although similar, these actually are totally different types of cakes. Mostly to do with how the eggs are incorporated. A white cake recipe only uses the whites of the egg, sometimes whipped and then folded into the batter, sometimes added directly to the butter/sugar mixture. Vanilla cake uses both the egg whites and the egg yolks (usually) and results in a slightly off-white colored cake but in my opinion has the most flavor. A yellow cake is made with the egg yolks only so the batter has a very rich and golden color with lots of flavor and is a very moist cake.
